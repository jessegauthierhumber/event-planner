## 💬 Team Reflection

> We faced some GitHub-related challenges initially, including repository ownership and merge conflicts. These issues helped us learn effective Git workflows and improved our team communication. Collaborating with different schedules also taught us the importance of flexibility, patience, and good planning.

### What We'd Do Differently

- Add more features like a pie chart for event budgets and include categories.
- Separate features into distinct pages for a more structured layout.
